Began by taking walks (Disha&amp;rsquo;s advice)   Got my first 100% in Paradox and Infinity Accepted into MPFG :D  Hotels were booked super fast   NC Scholarship sent an email out about prizes Finally got back to Laura and Dave  They didn&amp;rsquo;t reply back yet   Filled out Option II form  For a CS course, better luck    Maybe not so productive things I can&amp;rsquo;t believe that I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention the TSA application last time.</description>

      <description>Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s my first update. Things I&amp;rsquo;ve done in the past week-ish:
Productive things:  Start the end of physics C prep. Start attending New Horizons. (It&amp;rsquo;s more than halfway over ;-;.)  As a result, get pulled into way too many cool CS topics. This time, there is an actual doc with links.   Start the Sans Foundations course. Clean. up. my. room.  Maybe not so productive things:  Actually meet people this weekend!</description>

      <description>Hi :) My name is Shreya.
This is probably going to be my personal site. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.
Goals  Make a portfolio-over-the-years. Update regularly with what I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.  Attribution This site is made using Hugo and its PaperMod theme! Legend goes that I looked at 3b1b&amp;rsquo;s Manim documentation and loved its design. Obviously I have to start clicking on things to find more about this piece of code, so I came across Pradyun&amp;rsquo;s website, and loved this design too.</description>
