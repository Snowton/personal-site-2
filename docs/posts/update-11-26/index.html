Been a while. Let&rsquo;s just write stuff down now, shall we?
Productive things

Actually won the philosophy award!
Applied to NC Chapel Hill, MIT, Rutgers, Georgia Tech, UIUC, and Ohio State

Lots of essays&mldr; and self-reported coursework&mldr; and recommendation requests&mldr;


Applied for Ohio State Eminence scholarship
Did a sh*t ton of problem sets
Met up with Prof. Assadi again
Committed to AIME Prep
Randomly signed up for the USACO training thing that Amy showed me
Finally ordered t-shirts!
Got 4th place in PClassic !!!

Tied in # of correct submissions with the 3rd place team, but had more penalties than them (see the table at the bottom)


Tried to get the Halloween Math Meet going, but COVID restrictions made us decide to cancel
Oh, there was this Start Strong Testing thing in the beginning of October
I submitted, like, one problem to the Cyber Futures contest, and I don&rsquo;t think it was accepted because it was probably past the deadline on the 15th
Met with Ethan for exactly one Green Generation practice test
AMC 12A and 12B
Visited COS226 (Allen/Jason visited COS487 in turn)
Ended MP1

Maybe not so productive things

Went to a couple of houses for trick-or-treating
Tried to visit Sreemayi&rsquo;s class for her birthday, but COVID restrictions
Went out to eat a fair amount of times; most recent was at the Vietnamese place with most of the scioly captains

Was slightly awkward, but the food was good, I think
Went out to walk at the trail afterwards


Visited Krause a lot of times, and I TA for Z
Watched all seven Harry Potter movies (again)

Shourya seemed to enjoy them
Sreemayi is reading the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone!
Pinni gave us HP bookmarks; I have a bunch of Voldemort bookmarks now
I also read the entirety of the Half Blood Prince because Shourya got it from the library (without reading the first five books??)
About reading; I reread the first two Divergent books, which was interesting


Yesterday we also watched Aladdin when Babai/Pinni/Sreemayi when they came over for Thanksgiving dinner

Was quite interesting, actually, to actually sit at the table together for Thanksgiving


Got the chance to think about things I can&rsquo;t think about when I&rsquo;m playing ketchup
