I haven&rsquo;t posted on here since last year. I believe I&rsquo;m now sort of at a breather again. ?
productive things

I got into colleges, I&rsquo;ve chosen a college, now I&rsquo;m preparing for college.
I graduated !!! I have my diploma and everything. Shocking
Applied to summer programs and have been rejected; want to teach at PACT one last time. I should actually email Dr. Gandhi about that again.
I got scholarships :)
NCWIT national honorable mentino
National Cyber Scholar, again. They won&rsquo;t give me 3k more for the course
Got As on all my Princeton courses (did get a B on LIT tho)
Joined Gracie Barra BJJ after graduation

Okay, earlier things first: I dunno if I documented the &ldquo;csprinceton.org&rdquo; story here, or the SUNY Morrisville one, but now I have
I have a yearbook. My final school yearbook. I have the signatures separately
We watched Interstellar in physics

Why? cause I needed to make up credit. Why? cause I WENT TO INDIA FOR 2 AND A HALF WEEKS
Yeah, well, I did have to go to school on Saturdays, heh.

We had lots ahead of us, together."><meta name=author content="Shreya Mogulothu"><link rel=canonical href=https://smog.ink/posts/update-7-7-22/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.45e028aa8ce0961349adf411b013ee39406be2c0bc80d4ea3fc04555f7f4611a.css integrity="sha256-ReAoqozglhNJrfQRsBPuOUBr4sC8gNTqP8BFVff0YRo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://smog.ink/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://smog.ink/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://smog.ink/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://smog.ink/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://smog.ink/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://smog.ink/posts/update-7-7-22/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://smog.ink/posts/update-7-7-22/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Shreya Mogulothu"><meta property="og:title" content="Update 7/7/22"><meta property="og:description" content="hides behind wall I haven’t posted on here since last year.
