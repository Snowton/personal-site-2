<meta name=keywords content><meta name=description content="Hi again
Only a month until school&mldr;
Productive things

Did the rest of the lecture

Over two days


Talent show!

Recorded Pachtaoge with Disha
Was a massive procrastination fest
But very fun! 100% worth it
Figured out notes for the first time in a while


Went to most PACT lectures for Group II

Went to everything after first lecture except for last Friday evening(Vihan)


Freewrote a bit

Nothing very important, but it helped to just write



Maybe not so productive things

Went to four different places five different times over three days and spent at least 2 hours at each place

Puja (very long!): Friday afternoon/night
Manabadi photoshoot: Saturday morning
Another &ldquo;puja&rdquo; (ended up just being Reenu, Nikhi, and I hanging out with/without Milo because I arrived late): Saturday noon-evening
Baby shower?: Saturday night (also at Babai-Pinni&rsquo;s house)
Dinner: Sunday late afternoon-night (with Sanju and Sidharth)


Consequently got sick

No idea what it is
Had to cancel lecture on Tuesday and reschedule to Thursday
Apparently I had to have a coughing fit in the middle of lecture Thursday :(
Was bad first two days and then got better but it hasn&rsquo;t gone away yet ;-;
So yes, I unfortunately had to sing on a sore throat


Talked about very random stuff after lecture
Lifted basketball hoop!
Guacamole recipe:

1/2 Avocado
A bit of onion (chopped)
Some lemon (squeezed)
A sprinkle of cumin
Salt
