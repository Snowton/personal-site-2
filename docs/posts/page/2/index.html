This is probably going to be my personal site. We’ll see.
Goals Make a portfolio-over-the-years. Update regularly with what I’ve been working on. Attribution This site is made using Hugo and its PaperMod theme! Legend goes that I looked at 3b1b’s Manim documentation and loved its design. Obviously I have to start clicking on things to find more about this piece of code, so I came across Pradyun’s website, and loved this design too. At this point I was kind of mind blown that there were really themes I thought were sleek and actually usable, so I zoomed over to Hugo, and a day later, here we are.
