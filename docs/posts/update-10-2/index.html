Very much has been happening very quickly, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m going to forget something I did in these past two months that past-me would be angry I left out.
Productive things

Chose Princeton courses

And yes, they started
Managed to take COS487 :)

Actually made some friends there?


And yes, actually submitted all hw on time (so far, hopefully forever)


Met with Prof. Assadi

Still have to finish that writeup
And email again


Finished all summer hw (well, almost, not the secondary book for Lit yet)

Did the APUSH summer hw qusetions in one night ;-;


Finished SANS

Access until October 31
Signed up for Cyber Futures


Still use journal but not as extensively
Submitted Paradox and Infinity submission(s!)
Submitted National Merit Scholarship semifinalist documents or whatever

Involves actually writing an essay


Got permit!
Did Science Olympiad tryouts
Filled out general Common App questions and specific college questions, but not any essays
CS Club started

Has over 90 members now? So far?


Oh, did a college essay bootcamp in August, was interesting
Started Numbers Don&rsquo;t Lie around that time
Oh and was pronouncer for Nationals
Did some random interesting things

Maybe not so productive things

Chaitanya Uncle left, and I got to meet his daughter who is very adorable
Went to a college visit trip which was very massive and awesome
Shortly after stood in DMV line for around 3 hours (2 of which were outdoors in the sun and heat) to get permit
Am driving around to school and Princeton which is very cool
Sometimes eat lunch with other Princeton kids (only twice now, both on Fridays)
Somehow got convinced to do scioly

Probably won&rsquo;t get to be on actual team but whatever


Am entirely very surprised with how much I got done these past two weeks
Chose to do CJLH for Halloween
Still no bike repair
We played basketball yesterday because it was a bit warmer, but someone was draining their swimming pool so there was a river under the hoop, and the ball kept splashing in there, it was very funny
And yes, got to meet everyone again, and I love it
Anni usually drives me to school
Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t do yoga in the mornings anymore

I hope this will change, but&mldr;
