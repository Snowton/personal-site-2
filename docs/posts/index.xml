      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m getting the hang of this Let&amp;rsquo;s hope I don&amp;rsquo;t jinx it.
Productive things  Met with advisor, finished a writeup on results from RSW18  Still need to complete reading AD21   Went to Strogatz award ceremony Tried sticking to schedule but failed because it takes way too long to read papers Wrote emails to recommenders Started Paradox and Infinity Started some other philosophy course  Maybe not so productive things  Went to Babai/Pinni&amp;rsquo;s Went to Jhopri&amp;rsquo;s with Amy after the ceremony  Then went to the park with Anni Then ate boba ice cream, which was SO GOOD   Watched a whole ton of Big Shot Watched Ant Man and the Wasp  </description>

      <description>Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s my first update. Things I&amp;rsquo;ve done in the past week-ish:
Productive things:  Start the end of physics C prep. Start attending New Horizons. (It&amp;rsquo;s more than halfway over ;-;.)  As a result, get pulled into way too many cool CS topics. This time, there is an actual doc with links.   Start the Sans Foundations course. Clean. up. my. room.  Maybe not so productive things:  Actually meet people this weekend!</description>

      <description>Hi :) My name is Shreya.
This is probably going to be my personal site. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.
Goals  Make a portfolio-over-the-years. Update regularly with what I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.  Attribution This site is made using Hugo and its PaperMod theme! Legend goes that I looked at 3b1b&amp;rsquo;s Manim documentation and loved its design. Obviously I have to start clicking on things to find more about this piece of code, so I came across Pradyun&amp;rsquo;s website, and loved this design too.</description>
