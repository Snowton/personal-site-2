[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m ASEing diffeq this IAP. The test is tomorrow, I\u0026rsquo;m finishing up the final sections of the homework packet. I don\u0026rsquo;t have too much time before 8.20 lecture today, so I\u0026rsquo;ll instead do a little review:\nhow fast are you going? basically with diffeq we\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve equations that relate how fast you\u0026rsquo;re going (and acceleration, and higher orders) with the function itself. most of the diffeqs we are able to solve are of the form $$ \\sum a_n(x) y^{(n)} = f(x) $$ which is linear in y, so we call it a linear differential equation.\nthe main things to know are (1) how to solve for a general, homogenous solution (i.e. imagine $f(x)=0$), (2) how to find a particular solution, and (3) how to visualize the solutions to an equation without solving for it if you can\u0026rsquo;t do (1) and (2), especially when the coefficients $a_n$ aren\u0026rsquo;t constant. Also, know how to do this for systems of diffeqs, with matrices.\nwhy are (1) and (2) separate? there are many solutions $y_i$ to a diffeq (without initial values), related by the fact that $y_i - y_j$ is a solution to the homogenous diffeq. So we just need to find a single particular solution to a diffeq, and then add any linear combination of solutions for the homogenous diffeq to get the full set of solutions to the equation.\nwe proceed to outline how to find solutions (1),(2) in the case where $a_n$ are constant.\nhomogenous solution imagine that $f(x)$ is 0, and then solve. do this by guessing $y = e^{rx}$, so after substituting into the equation and dividing by $y$ you get $\\sum a_n r^n = 0$, the characteristic equation. Solve this equation to get all the possible $r$, and a linear combination of the independent functions $e^{rt}$ gives you the general solution. for a repeated root $s$ of multiplicity k, the corresponding independent functions are $s^j e^{st}$ for all $0 \\leq j \u0026lt; k$.\nIf the characteristic equation has complex roots, note that $c_1e^{a + bi} + c_2 e^{a - bi} = e^a (d_1 \\cos(z) + d_2 \\sin(z))$ through a linear transformation of coefficients $c_1 = (d_1 + d_2/i)/2$ and $c_2 = (d_1 - d_2/i)/2$, so you can use $e^{at} \\cos(bt)$ and $e^{at} \\sin(bt)$ for which you can find real coefficients $d_1, d_2$. (otherwise you will need some restrictions on $c_1, c_2$ if you use the complex exponentials in a basis for your real solution $y$.)\nparticular solution goal: we want a $y$ such that $$ \\sum a_n y^{(n)} = f(x) $$ therefore we want a $y$ such that $f(x)$ is a particular linear combination of it and its derivatives. then if $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $k$ in $x$, we can guess a particular solution for $y$, call it $y_p$, is also a polynomial of degree $k$, so that taking a linear combination of derivatives of $y_p$ in the LHS is also a polynomial of degree $k$ in $x$, just like $f(x$). then equating coefficients will give us $k$ equations to solve for the $k$ coefficients in $y_p$. if the equations have multiple solutions, we only need one, as we can get the rest from adding the general homogenous solution.\nsimilarly, if $f(x)$ is some linear combination of $\\sin(ax)$ and $\\cos(ax)$, we know that the derivatives of these are also linear combinations of $\\sin(ax)$ and $\\cos(ax)$, so we guess $y_p$ as such a linear combination, so that plugging in gives us a linear combination of these functions on the LHS, just like $f(x)$, and equating coefficients gives us 2 equations for the 2 variables. see the pattern? (it\u0026rsquo;s reasonably called the method of undetermined coefficients.) the last case is when $f(x)$ is a constant times $e^{ax}$, in which case we guess $f(x)$ is of the same form. notice that the sine and cosine case reduces to the exponential case by representing them with complex exponentials.\nobviously, we can find a particular solution where $f(x)$ is a linear combination of functions $\\sum a_i g_i(x)$ that fit in these three cases by finding particular solutions $y_{p,i}$ where the RHS is each $g_i$, and then taking $\\sum a_i y_{p,i}$ to be a particular solution to when the RHS is $f(x)$. this is because the differentiation operator is linear. less obviously a function that is any product of the cases is also solvable using the same principle of guessing $y_p$ such that $f(x)$ can be represented as a linear combination of $n$ derivatives of $y_p$.\nsomething i overlooked is\u0026hellip; what if the form we choose for $y_p$ is a solution to the homogenous equation? then $\\sum a_n y_p^{(n)}$ is $0 \\neq f(x)$. in this case, we just multiply our initial guess for $y_p$ by $x$ until it no longer becomes a solution to the homogenous equation. we can see this works by noting $f(x)$ must then be a linear combination of exponentials or a power of $x$ times an exponential, so we just take one at a time, say $g_i(x) = x^t e^{rx}$. Then $r$ must be an $s$-fold root of the characteristic equation $p$ (where $s \u0026gt; t$), where $p(D)y_p$ is the RHS, so that the equation can be can be written as $q(D)(D-r)^s y_p = g_i(x)$. Then do $(D-r)^t$ on both sides, so we get $q(D)(D-r)^{s+t}y_p = 0$, so $y_p$ must be a solution to this homogenous equation. However, it cannot be a solution to the original $p(D)y = 0$, as we\u0026rsquo;ve seen. So it must be a linear combination of powers of $x$ times $e^{rx}$; in particular the powers $m$ of $x$ must be at least $s$ so that $x^m e^{rx}$ is not a solution to $p(D)y = 0$. Therefore our particular solution $y_p$ for $p(D)y = \\sum a_n y^{(n)} = g_i(x) = x^t e^{rx}$ will consist of a linear combination of terms $x^m e^{rx}$ where $s \\leq m \u0026lt; s+t$.\nsystems of equations You can turn any system of higher-order differential equations to a system of first order of differential equations by introducing more variables for every higher order (other than the highest order, of course). if this is a linear homogenous system, you can represent it a a matrix $\\mathbf{x}\u0026rsquo; = A\\mathbf{x}$ where A is a constant matrix. Then you can guess normal modes $\\mathbf{x} = e^{\\lambda t} \\mathbf{v}$, and plugging it in tells you $\\mathbf{v}$ must be an eigenvector with $\\lambda$ as an eigenvalue. finding all of the eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues gives you all of the normal modes, and you can take a linear combination of these to get the general solution. for complex eigenvalues, you can get real basis functions instead by taking the real and complex parts of $e^{\\lambda t} v$. for repeated eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of multiplicity $k$, the good (\u0026ldquo;complete\u0026rdquo;) case is when the there are $k$ distinct eigenvectors, but for 2 dimensions the matrix would just be $$\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\lambda \u0026amp; 0 \\\n0 \u0026amp; \\lambda \\end{bmatrix}$$which is generally not the case, and if it was you\u0026rsquo;d know it well beforehand. instead, for 2 dimensions, use a linear combination $\\mathbf{z} = (\\vec{\\beta} + \\vec{\\alpha}t)e^t$ where $\\vec{\\alpha}$ is the eigenvector you found, and $\\vec{\\beta}$ is a solution to $(A - \\lambda I) \\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{\\alpha}$ (which you can verify by plugging $\\mathbf{z}$ in to the original system $\\mathbf{x}\u0026rsquo; = A \\mathbf{x}$ yourself). since $(A - \\lambda I)$ is singular (for the 2d case), this system must be solved by elimination, without inverses. for higher dimensional cases, the general solution essentially tacks on more powers of $t$ as usual. see this pdf for more details\u0026hellip; but\u0026hellip;\nit may be simpler to just \u0026ldquo;flatten\u0026rdquo; the $n$-dimensional system into an $n$-th order linear diffeq and solve it using its characteristic equation. this is done by eliminating any variable $x_i$ by writing it as a linear combination of the other dimensions and their derivatives, and then thereby writing $\\dot{x_i}$ as a derivative of said linear combination, which is a linear combination of one higher order. rinse and repeat until you only have one variable. this process called elimination, but i like \u0026ldquo;flatten\u0026rdquo; better.\nif you can change bases to one where you get a diagonal matrix, can write $A = S^{-1}\\Lambda S$. then solution is $$S^{-1}\\begin{bmatrix}\ne^\\lambda_1 \u0026amp; 0 \\\n0 \u0026amp; e^\\lambda_2 \\end{bmatrix} S$$ which we define to be $e^{At}$, as the definition for that is \u0026ldquo;$e^{At}\\mathbf{x(0)}$ is a solution to $\\mathbf{x}\u0026rsquo; = A\\mathbf{x}$\u0026rdquo;. S is a matrix that has eigenvectors of A as columns. doing a change of basis makes the evolution of variables very easy to compute/visualize!\ni can\u0026rsquo;t solve it\u0026hellip; no worries, differential equations are not all solvable! there are a couple of methods that you can use to figure out how it generally looks, depending on your resources and needs.\nuse a computer what does a computer use though? 2. a variant of euler\u0026rsquo;s method (original: find $x(x_0+\\epsilon)$ using derivative at $x_0$, which gives you more accuracy as $\\epsilon$ decreases, until rounding errors overtake and suddenly you get less accuracy because they accumulate faster as $\\epsilon$ decreases) 1. variant basically finds a guess for $x(x_0 + \\epsilon)$ using $x\u0026rsquo;(x_0)$ (call the guess $g$), but actually set $x(x_0 + \\epsilon)$ using average of derivatives $x\u0026rsquo;(x_0)$ and $x\u0026rsquo;(g)$. we get much better accuracy for the same epsilon using this method compared to regular euler euler\u0026rsquo;s method is good for when you want precision for a particular trajectory i\u0026rsquo;ve only outlined the case where $x\u0026rsquo; = f(x)$, but works for any first-order ODE $x\u0026rsquo; = f(x,t)$ as well of course, just increment $t$ instead of $x$ directly what if you want to visualize things without as much computation power first-order ODE $y\u0026rsquo; = f(x,y)$ direction field: at various $(x,y)$ draw $y\u0026rsquo;$. easy to do by focusing on isoclines, curves where $f(x,y)$ is a constant, can draw the same slope $c$ along the entire curve 2d homogenous system $\\mathbf{x\u0026rsquo;} = A\\mathbf{x}$ 9 different types of systems depending on trace and determinant of $A$ node (real eigenvalues of same sign); can be stable or unstable saddle (real eigenvalues of different sign); always unstable spiral (complex eigenvalues with nonzero real part); can be stable or unstable center (only imaginary eigenvalues) comb (one eigenvalue is 0) star (complete repeated eigenvalue) degenerate node (repeated eigenvalue, not complete) conclusion exponential functions are really cool! in fact, $e^x$ was basically defined to be really cool (solution of $y\u0026rsquo; = y$)!\nresources material for the hw packets mostly come from https://math.mit.edu/~jorloff/suppnotes/suppnotes03/ASENotesAndExercises.html and chapters 1,2,8 of Edwards and Penney, Elementary Differential Equations with Boundary-Value Problem, 6th edition, Prentice-Hall.\n","permalink":"https://smog.ink/posts/diffeq/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m ASEing diffeq this IAP.

I\u0026rsquo;m really happy you\u0026rsquo;re into the arts and trust tech enough to look for a software solution, but unless you want to just detect the pitch of a melody (one note at any moment) this is pretty hard to do in the general case.\nBackground: my brother was complaining about the amount of time it took to write sheet music in notating software for his compositions, and my initial reaction was \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s part of the deal\u0026rdquo;, the idea being that if you\u0026rsquo;re making a composition, you should at least spend the amount of time with it that you\u0026rsquo;d take to notate it, to give it the kind of care and thought that will make it sound deliberate. My brother usually just comes up with things on the fly after many repetitions of experimenting on the keyboard and will record them and use up all of our iCloud storage, which is very exciting but not great for our picture taking capacity.\nSo I was thinking about it a little bit more, because it is true that some people can just come up with beautiful pieces after a few minutes of thinking. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really fully believe this until I read the first chapter of Godel, Escher, Bach, which was, sure enough, about Bach composing fugues on the spot. So clearly there is a use case for real-time score creation. And I mean, I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of the youtube video \u0026ldquo;BMO sings please never fall in love again\u0026rdquo;, which was created via a neural net trained on BMO\u0026rsquo;s voice and that can recreate any melody in that voice! And so I felt confident enough in technology to tell my brother that yeah, there is probably a tech solution to this that might involve a neural net, and I\u0026rsquo;d look into creating something for him.\nWell, I tried to on around Nov 29. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it went.\nnaiveté At first I was just like \u0026ldquo;neural networks do be too annoying. What if I just take a Fourier transform! I didn\u0026rsquo;t take unified signals for nothing\u0026rdquo;. But there were two issues with this thought. One was I didn\u0026rsquo;t really pay attention in class to the discrete version of this so I didn\u0026rsquo;t have full intuition on how to code this up. But second, I realized what I was looking for actually had to be a sliding FT, which I had implicitly required but for some reason in my head I forgot frequencies in FTs weren\u0026rsquo;t calculated per-instant, and that they needed time to accurately detect frequency. Heisenberg inequality style. Quite obviously the FT of the entire thing would be useless to me.\nSo then I found ways to convert mp3 files into .wav files so that python could read them into numpy, and then I took a sliding dft using the python library, and simply tried to graph it. I got actual nonsense. it was just noise all the way through. So then I limited the graph to frequencies a piano could reasonably play, and then I got some signal way in the lower section of the graph, where I presume my brother was playing! But it was still too tiny to make out, so I restricted the time axis to a few seconds at the beginning of when he plays (different from the beginning of the recording) and adjusted the stft settings to value note precision over knowledge of when exactly he played it (i.e. lengthen the sliding time). And then I was left with the below graph.\nSo I was like, cool! I\u0026rsquo;ll figure out what note he\u0026rsquo;s playing, and then I\u0026rsquo;ll graph that horizontal line as well. So it turns out he\u0026rsquo;s playing a c5, and then an f5. I don\u0026rsquo;t graph the entire horizontal line because it would block out the actual heatmap:\nThe MOST ANNOYING THING about this graph is that the frequencies most represented at each time ARE NOT THE NOTE THAT IS BEING PLAYED.\nannoyance And so I searched online about what harmonic qualities pianos have, and got some answers about guitars. It turns out that a viable option is recording a note, figuring out the frequency plot, and then using that as a baseline from which you can figure out what all of the other notes are supposed to look like. Mathematica has an article on this, linked here.\nBut importantly, this is NOT a solution if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to find all of the notes in a chord. Because it\u0026rsquo;s nontrivial to figure out which notes are added together if your harmonic spectrum is all over the place. Or it might have been simple in a better world, but when I searched up solutions for chord detection, people were trying to use neural nets, a sure signal that this problem is just not solvable by normal algorithms yet. People were even writing research papers [todo: link] about ways that they were training them/applying loss. And of course, there were plenty of people just shaking their heads at newcomers to this game and telling them that it was just a very hard problem.\nAnd THEN I was like, okay. My only hope now is using MIDI output, if our piano has that ability. And then I watched [this] youtube video from a guy who turns MIDI output into a score, and it is STILL painstaking detail-oriented work, although maybe not as much as writing every note on the staff. I wonder if my brother would think it\u0026rsquo;s an upgrade. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if the software the guy in the video is using is proprietary, but if it is I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll deal with that problem if I have the luxury of using MIDI.\nthat\u0026rsquo;s all folks Let\u0026rsquo;s do this another time :)\naside: as i created the file for this post, i realized how little posts i actually have on here so far. it\u0026rsquo;s a very stark contrast compared to the other vaults!\n","permalink":"https://smog.ink/posts/pitch-detection/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"so-you-want-to-pitch-detect\"\u003eso you want to pitch detect.\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m really happy you\u0026rsquo;re into the arts and trust tech enough to look for a software solution, but unless you want to just detect the pitch of a melody (one note at any moment) this is pretty hard to do in the general case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBackground: my brother was complaining about the amount of time it took to write sheet music in notating software for his compositions, and my initial reaction was \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s part of the deal\u0026rdquo;, the idea being that if you\u0026rsquo;re making a composition, you should at least spend the amount of time with it that you\u0026rsquo;d take to notate it, to give it the kind of care and thought that will make it sound deliberate.

Or what it is that I want in the first place.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a space of thoughts I could have. They range from very untrue to very true, and the reason it\u0026rsquo;s a range and not black and white is because every sentence has inflections and subtleties that can paint a mental image that\u0026rsquo;s closer or further from the high dimensional idea we\u0026rsquo;re trying to communicate. So I want to hone in on the true side of this spectrum of thoughts, and in that I want to mark the ones I endorse. Moreover, I don\u0026rsquo;t want the branching factor to be high. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that the thoughts people think about things are very diverse at all. There are many contexts in which we think thoughts, but the flavors of thoughts themselves we\u0026rsquo;ve mostly all thought already. It\u0026rsquo;s rare indeed that we experience new emotions.\nI\u0026rsquo;m writing this later in the night and my track record of posting is low enough that I won\u0026rsquo;t edit this one either, but in order to make the branching factor lower and revisit thoughts/form connections I am slowly opening up to the concept of editing and polishing.

I have lots of thoughts in my head but they never actually pertain to the topic at hand. Either they\u0026rsquo;re too meta or too focused on what\u0026rsquo;s actually around me.

(graph streaming!!!) what should i be paying attention to right now? absolutely no clue. when did people realize oppenheimer would be a name they would have to start paying attention to? certainly not when he was a \u0026ldquo;depressed\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;socially awkward\u0026rdquo; teen.\ndo i even want to be seen? if influencing history is a matter of immense grit and luck, i have to be careful what i wish for, even if it seems romantic from the outside.\ngoing back to the present; i\u0026rsquo;m here and anguished, right? working through my thoughts on being healthy and running and stuff and that\u0026rsquo;s completely opposite of oppenheimer\u0026rsquo;s like, lack of concern for his own health and general manicness. combined with barbie\u0026rsquo;s depiction of aging, like, i do want to be healthy. aesthetics matter more for me in particular because of lack of any particular genius or output on my end\u0026hellip; a benefit of the doubt type thing would do me well. maybe if i were a man i\u0026rsquo;d have better metabolism or people would take me more seriously, but probably that\u0026rsquo;s also a 20th century thing, and also came with lots of family money.\nand through all of the walking around and spitting out thoughts and gesturing that helps me put them on the page, i wonder\u0026hellip; how much of it is performative? it hurts me to entertain the idea, but i have to. i\u0026rsquo;m in an empty room with just me right now, but i am talking to you and voicing these things, right? and i just used focusmate to help me start writing, but i should be able to do the same thing with a place like wework or a cafe with people keeping each other focused there too. what then? would i have the leisure to walk around frustrated as i do here? or would it be more performative? i wish it weren\u0026rsquo;t because i\u0026rsquo;d also do this on my own. but i want the accountability, just none of the being seen. but that is where the accountability comes from.\ni went back and read the thing and made a few additions but i\u0026rsquo;m too tired to edit it. it wasn\u0026rsquo;t meant to be a comprehensive and easily understandable guide to my feelings on the movie anyway, and there\u0026rsquo;s the same barrier to entry thing i want for the last two paragraphs, because they\u0026rsquo;re the more vulnerable parts of the writing. but in particular i want to pay attention to the kind of \u0026ldquo;make a difference\u0026rdquo; sentiment i seem to be expressing here. i don\u0026rsquo;t want power and i don\u0026rsquo;t think any of this was meant in a power seeking tone. i think it\u0026rsquo;s the i feel like my life or my time is more valuable when i feel justified in throwing it towards a worthy cause. a cause that would see no difference because of my working on it is probaby not a cause i should be participating in. i don\u0026rsquo;t know what exactly it is that i wish for. what ambition it is in me that oppenheimer speaks to. because normally i\u0026rsquo;m a pretty detached theory kind of person, but the vibes of the movie really are romantic in a way, but what is it? maybe it\u0026rsquo;s the shared delusion of everyone working on the project, and the way the delusion is shared makes it real and earthly and tangible. maybe i want to be part of a shared delusion that is so strong it manifests in something worldly. i don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nuncensored thoughts, feel free to tell me if i\u0026rsquo;m being cringe :)\n","permalink":"https://smog.ink/posts/barbenheimer/","summary":"\u003cp\u003esee if you can catch the barbie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"outside-text\"\u003eoutside text\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eso uh in retrospect this was in fact supposed to be a formal writing, but in the end it became much more informal and exposed less well-formed thoughts.

I\u0026rsquo;ve written much inwards-facing material in the past year but not really anything public. Often the things I\u0026rsquo;ve had to really think about were personal issues, and naturally I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t post about them. But also I\u0026rsquo;m just lazy and screening your own writing for publishability takes effort.\nBut I think it\u0026rsquo;s valuable in setting a precedent for yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s practice for when you want to do a good write-up of nebulous thoughts you\u0026rsquo;re having about political systems or efficient ways of communicating long chains of thoughts. It helps develop style. All of these are obvious, but it\u0026rsquo;s only becoming clear to me now that these are things I might want for myself enough to write publicly regularly. Perhaps I won\u0026rsquo;t actually make this a priority, but I believe in it enough now to post this. I have to do more about interlinkage between thoughts I have, but that will come later and with some tinkering between Hugo and Obsidian.

We\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nGoals Make a portfolio-over-the-years. Update regularly with what I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on. Attribution This site is made using Hugo and its PaperMod theme! Legend goes that I looked at 3b1b\u0026rsquo;s Manim documentation and loved its design. Obviously I have to start clicking on things to find more about this piece of code, so I came across Pradyun\u0026rsquo;s website, and loved this design too. At this point I was kind of mind blown that there were really themes I thought were sleek and actually usable, so I zoomed over to Hugo, and a day later, here we are.\nProbably my favorite thing is that there\u0026rsquo;s an easy way to write math in here! Although it\u0026rsquo;s not as versatile as Coffee and Sleep\u0026ndash;you still need to use the terminal and write in files, and it\u0026rsquo;s static, so you have to deploy new changes to master\u0026ndash;I still really like it.\nAt first I was going to just use some template right out of the box, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t really work out so well. I tried out a few themes, gave up on the ones that weren\u0026rsquo;t PaperMod, and then figured I needed things to change about PaperMod too. It took a while to figure it out, but I did edit the search template to include links to tag/category search, the post pages to actually show the category (why isn\u0026rsquo;t that default?), and the footer as well. I really did try to do something cool with the footer, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t animate well, so here we are. Again, it took me a while to find how to edit the template in the first place, so I guess my chances were low. I think it was okay to just edit the submodule. I\u0026hellip; don\u0026rsquo;t know though\u0026hellip; so let\u0026rsquo;s hope PaperMod doesn\u0026rsquo;t update.\nActually, I\u0026rsquo;m getting a bit scared. I\u0026rsquo;m going to put the code here.\nHalf an hour later I looked into the submodule issue. It was, obviously, an issue. So much for wishful thinking. But I just changed it, so it\u0026rsquo;s not a submodule anymore, and I can edit however I like, but that also means I won\u0026rsquo;t get updates. That\u0026rsquo;s fine though\u0026ndash;I can just add the actual submodule elsewhere, maybe?\nI\u0026rsquo;ll still put the code down there, though. For the curious, I guess.\nSee you around,\nShreya\nthemes/PaperMod/layouts/partials/footer.html\n{{- if .Site.Params.attribution }} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;footer-hide-wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div {{- if .Site.Params.attributionAnimation }} class=\u0026#34;footer-hide\u0026#34; {{- end }}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span\u0026gt; \u0026amp;nbsp;·\u0026amp;nbsp; Powered by \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://gohugo.io/\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;noopener noreferrer\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Hugo\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; + \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://git.io/hugopapermod\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;noopener\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;PaperMod\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, with tweaks \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{- end }} themes/PaperMod/assets/css/common/footer.css\n/* my code */ .footer-hide-wrapper { display: inline-block; /* transition: width 1s; */ /* overflow: hidden; */ } .footer .footer-hide { display: inline-block; /* overflow: hidden; */ opacity: 0; max-width: 0; height: 0; line-height: 20px; transition: none; } .footer:hover .footer-hide { content: attr(\u0026#34;data-hover\u0026#34;); max-width: 100%; opacity: 100%; transition: opacity 1s, max-width 0.5s; } themes/PaperMod/layouts/_default/single.html\n{{- if .Params.categories }} \u0026lt;ul class=\u0026#34;entry-isdraft\u0026#34; style=\u0026#34;list-style-type: none; display: inline-block;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{- range ($.GetTerms \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;) }} \u0026lt;li style=\u0026#34;display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ .LinkTitle }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{- end }} \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; {{- end }} themes/PaperMod/layouts/_default/search.html\n\u0026lt;!-- my div --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;search-btn post-tags\u0026#34; style=\u0026#34;padding: 0 0 20px 0;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ \u0026#34;\u0026#34; | absLangURL }}/tags/\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Search by tag \u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ \u0026#34;\u0026#34; | absLangURL }}/categories/\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Search by category \u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ","permalink":"https://smog.ink/posts/first-post/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"hi-\"\u003eHi :)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy name is Shreya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is probably going to be my personal site.
