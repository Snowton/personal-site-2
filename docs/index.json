We\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nGoals  Make a portfolio-over-the-years. Update regularly with what I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on.  Attribution This site is made using Hugo and its PaperMod theme! Legend goes that I looked at 3b1b\u0026rsquo;s Manim documentation and loved its design. Obviously I have to start clicking on things to find more about this piece of code, so I came across Pradyun\u0026rsquo;s website, and loved this design too. At this point I was kind of mind blown that there were really themes I thought were sleek and actually usable, so I zoomed over to Hugo, and a day later, here we are.\nProbably my favorite thing is that there\u0026rsquo;s an easy way to write math in here! Although it\u0026rsquo;s not as versatile as Coffee and Sleep\u0026ndash;you still need to use the terminal and write in files, and it\u0026rsquo;s static, so you have to deploy new changes to master\u0026ndash;I still really like it.\nAt first I was going to just use some template right out of the box, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t really work out so well. I tried out a few themes, gave up on the ones that weren\u0026rsquo;t PaperMod, and then figured I needed things to change about PaperMod too. It took a while to figure it out, but I did edit the search template to include links to tag/category search, the post pages to actually show the category (why isn\u0026rsquo;t that default?), and the footer as well. I really did try to do something cool with the footer, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t animate well, so here we are. Again, it took me a while to find how to edit the template in the first place, so I guess my chances were low. I think it was okay to just edit the submodule. I\u0026hellip; don\u0026rsquo;t know though\u0026hellip; so let\u0026rsquo;s hope PaperMod doesn\u0026rsquo;t update.\nActually, I\u0026rsquo;m getting a bit scared. I\u0026rsquo;m going to put the code here.\nHalf an hour later I looked into the submodule issue. It was, obviously, an issue. So much for wishful thinking. But I just changed it, so it\u0026rsquo;s not a submodule anymore, and I can edit however I like, but that also means I won\u0026rsquo;t get updates. That\u0026rsquo;s fine though\u0026ndash;I can just add the actual submodule elsewhere, maybe?\nI\u0026rsquo;ll still put the code down there, though. For the curious, I guess.\nSee you around,\nShreya\n themes/PaperMod/layouts/partials/footer.html\n{{- if .Site.Params.attribution }} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;footer-hide-wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div {{- if .Site.Params.attributionAnimation }} class=\u0026#34;footer-hide\u0026#34; {{- end }}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span\u0026gt; \u0026amp;nbsp;·\u0026amp;nbsp; Powered by \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://gohugo.io/\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;noopener noreferrer\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Hugo\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; + \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://git.io/hugopapermod\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;noopener\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;PaperMod\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, with tweaks \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{- end }} themes/PaperMod/assets/css/common/footer.css\n/* my code */ .footer-hide-wrapper { display: inline-block; /* transition: width 1s; */ /* overflow: hidden; */ } .footer .footer-hide { display: inline-block; /* overflow: hidden; */ opacity: 0; max-width: 0; height: 0; line-height: 20px; transition: none; } .footer:hover .footer-hide { content: attr(\u0026#34;data-hover\u0026#34;); max-width: 100%; opacity: 100%; transition: opacity 1s, max-width 0.5s; } themes/PaperMod/layouts/_default/single.html\n{{- if .Params.categories }} \u0026lt;ul class=\u0026#34;entry-isdraft\u0026#34; style=\u0026#34;list-style-type: none; display: inline-block;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{- range ($.GetTerms \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;) }} \u0026lt;li style=\u0026#34;display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ .LinkTitle }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{- end }} \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; {{- end }} themes/PaperMod/layouts/_default/search.html\n\u0026lt;!-- my div --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;search-btn post-tags\u0026#34; style=\u0026#34;padding: 0 0 20px 0;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ \u0026#34;\u0026#34; | absLangURL }}/tags/\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Search by tag \u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ \u0026#34;\u0026#34; | absLangURL }}/categories/\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Search by category \u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ","permalink":"https://snowton.github.io/personal-site-2/posts/first-post/","summary":"Hi :) My name is Shreya.\nThis is probably going to be my personal site.
