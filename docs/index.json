[{"content":"Hi :) My name is Shreya.\nThis is probably going to be my personal site. We\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nGoals  Make a portfolio-over-the-years. Update regularly with what I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on.  Attribution This site is made using Hugo and its PaperMod theme! Legend goes that I looked at 3b1b\u0026rsquo;s Manim documentation and loved its design. Obviously I have to start clicking on things to find more about this piece of code, so I came across Pradyun\u0026rsquo;s website, and loved this design too. At this point I was kind of mind blown that there were really themes I thought were sleek and adaptable for use, so I zoomed over to Hugo, and a day later, here we are.\nProbably my favorite thing is that there\u0026rsquo;s an easy way to write math in here! Although it\u0026rsquo;s not as versatile as Coffee and Sleep\u0026ndash;you still need to use the terminal and write in files, and it\u0026rsquo;s static, so you have to deploy new changes to master\u0026ndash;I still really like it.\nI did edit the Search template to include links to tag/category search, and the footer as well. I really tried to do something cool with the footer, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t animate well, so here we are. It took me a while to figure out how to edit the template in the first place. I think it was okay to just edit the submodule. I\u0026hellip; don\u0026rsquo;t know though\u0026hellip; so let\u0026rsquo;s hope PaperMod doesn\u0026rsquo;t update.\nActually, I\u0026rsquo;m getting a bit scared.
