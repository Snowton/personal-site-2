not sure if i can do this but we can try!!!

## when do maxwell's equations hold?

in particular, the equations imply a wave equation for light where the speed of light is c, but doesn't specify a frame in which this is true. originally people thought this was because there's a "luminiferous ether" that light propagates in, but when they did experiments testing the speed of light on earth when it might be moving in opposite directions wrt the ether, they found no actual difference in speed! light was moving at the same speed no matter how the earth was moving wrt the supposed ether! lorentz argued this may be because moving objects experience "length contraction" along the axis of motion to explain this result while still believing that light propagates through an ether. 

einstein thought, no way we're still sticking to the ether hypothesis after this null result. instead let's consider what happens if we think light might actually propagate at the same speed no matter your inertial frame of reference. he ended up with the same transformation (indeed, involving length contraction) that lorentz derived beforehand, but no need for ether!

Say you're in the S (inertial) frame, and I'm moving away from you at a speed of $+v$ along the $x$ axis in the S' frame, but we both start at $x=x'=0$ at $t=t'=0$. Then for all other events $(t,x)$, we can find the equivalent event $(t',x')$ using the lorentz transformation:
$$x' = (x - \frac{v}{c} (ct))$$
$$ct' = (ct - \frac{v}{c} (x))$$
(any other coordinates of the event $y$ and $z$ will remain unchanged)
