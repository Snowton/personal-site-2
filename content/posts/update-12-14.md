## here we go again

Let's get to it. I'm doing this mostly because I really should, it's been a couple of weeks. I'm not at a breather yet, although maybe a little.

### Productive things
- Got advice on classes to take in Princeton for spring semester
- Applied to UCs, and apparently USC
- Got PACT T-Shirt and SANS hoodie!!
- Got to think about things
- Managed to submit all of my last psets :))
- Did my two algebra lectures for AIME prep
- Srushti came to CS Club for a guest lecture!!!
- Did an instant decision day interview at SUNY Morrisville for massage therapy (got in)
- Accepted into Ohio State !!! (dunno about scholarship)
- Did basketball tryouts! But only for a day, I ditched after that
- Updated a singular new post on Coffee and Sleep for newcomers
- Attended a theory seminar thing and talked for like two minutes
    - Note to future mes: always check slide compilations ;-;

### Maybe not so productive things
- It was my birthday !! And we went to an escape room and it was all VERY FUN and I 100% recommend this for my future self, would do again
    - We managed to eat at a2b before that, and ate hot breads on the day of
    - Amy and Anni and Priya came
    - Lots of balloons!
        - Later I actually made one float in midair (more or less? it's kind of hard to balance) by weighting it with a bag of murukus, carefully curated
    - Anni gave me a clock LOL and Amy gave me a bobabear and Priya gave me a super soft blanket and chocolates and a really really nice leather(?) cover book with the world etched on it and it looks super sleek so I love to use it when I need scratch paper that's not the iPad
- There was a puja too, on Reenu's birthday, and it was also quite fun
    - Went to SHP in the morning ^^; was fun and Reenu was there too and she just got snapchat so there are some hilarious videos from that
    - Then there was food and it was so gooddd
    - We finally got to play CLUE! Yay
- College decisions started to come out and they're pretty scary but we'll see, nothing I can do now ><
