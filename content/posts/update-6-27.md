## I'm getting the hang of this

Let's hope I don't jinx it.

### Productive things

- Met with advisor, finished a writeup on results from RSW18
    - Still need to complete reading AD21
- Went to Strogatz award ceremony
- Tried sticking to schedule but failed because it takes way too long to read papers
- Wrote emails to recommenders
- Started Paradox and Infinity
- Started some other philosophy course

### Maybe not so productive things
- Went to Babai/Pinni's
- Went to Jhopri's with Amy after the ceremony
    - Then went to the park with Anni
    - Then ate boba ice cream, which was SO GOOD
- Watched a whole ton of Big Shot
- Watched Ant Man and the Wasp
