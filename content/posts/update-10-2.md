## hello there

Very much has been happening very quickly, and I'm sure I'm going to forget something I did in these past two months that past-me would be angry I left out.

### Productive things

- Chose Princeton courses
    - And yes, they started
    - Managed to take COS487 :)
        - Actually made some friends there?
    - And yes, actually submitted all hw on time (so far, hopefully forever)
- Met with Prof. Assadi
    - Still have to finish that writeup
    - And email again
- Finished all summer hw (well, almost, not the secondary book for Lit yet)
    - Did the APUSH summer hw qusetions in one night ;-;
- Finished SANS
    - Access until October 31
    - Signed up for Cyber Futures
- Still use journal but not as extensively
- Submitted Paradox and Infinity submission(s!)
- Submitted National Merit Scholarship semifinalist documents or whatever
    - Involves actually writing an essay
- Got permit!
- Did Science Olympiad tryouts
- Filled out general Common App questions and specific college questions, but not any essays
- CS Club started
    - Has over 90 members now? So far?
- Oh, did a college essay bootcamp in August, was interesting
- Started Numbers Don't Lie around that time
- Oh and was pronouncer for Nationals
- Did some random interesting things

### Maybe not so productive things

- Chaitanya Uncle left, and I got to meet his daughter who is very adorable
- Went to a college visit trip which was very massive and awesome
- Shortly after stood in DMV line for around 3 hours (2 of which were outdoors in the sun and heat) to get permit
- Am driving around to school and Princeton which is very cool
- Sometimes eat lunch with other Princeton kids (only twice now, both on Fridays)
- Somehow got convinced to do scioly
    - Probably won't get to be on actual team but whatever
- Am entirely very surprised with how much I got done these past two weeks
- Chose to do CJLH for Halloween
- Still no bike repair
- We played basketball yesterday because it was a bit warmer, but someone was draining their swimming pool so there was a river under the hoop, and the ball kept splashing in there, it was very funny
- And yes, got to meet everyone again, and I love it
- Anni usually drives me to school
- Unfortunately I don't do yoga in the mornings anymore
    - I hope this will change, but...
