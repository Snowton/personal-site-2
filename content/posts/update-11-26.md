## hi...

Been a while. Let's just write stuff down now, shall we?

### Productive things

- Actually won the philosophy award!
- Applied to NC Chapel Hill, MIT, Rutgers, Georgia Tech, UIUC, and Ohio State
    - Lots of essays... and self-reported coursework... and recommendation requests...
- Applied for Ohio State Eminence scholarship
- Did a sh*t ton of problem sets
- Met up with Prof. Assadi again
- Committed to AIME Prep
- Randomly signed up for the USACO training thing that Amy showed me
- Finally ordered t-shirts!
- Got 4th place in PClassic !!!
    - Tied in # of correct submissions with the 3rd place team, but had more penalties than them (see the table at the bottom)
- Tried to get the Halloween Math Meet going, but COVID restrictions made us decide to cancel
- Oh, there was this Start Strong Testing thing in the beginning of October
- I submitted, like, one problem to the Cyber Futures contest, and I don't think it was accepted because it was probably past the deadline on the 15th
- Met with Ethan for exactly one Green Generation practice test
- AMC 12A and 12B
- Visited COS226 (Allen/Jason visited COS487 in turn)
- Ended MP1

### Maybe not so productive things

- Went to a couple of houses for trick-or-treating
- Tried to visit Sreemayi's class for her birthday, but COVID restrictions
- Went out to eat a fair amount of times; most recent was at the Vietnamese place with most of the scioly captains
    - Was slightly awkward, but the food was good, I think
    - Went out to walk at the trail afterwards
- Visited Krause a lot of times, and I TA for Z
- Watched all seven Harry Potter movies (again)
    - Shourya seemed to enjoy them
- Yesterday we also watched Aladdin when Babai/Pinni/Sreemayi when they came over for Thanksgiving dinner
    - Was quite interesting, actually, to *actually* sit at the table together for Thanksgiving
- Got the chance to think about things I can't think about when I'm playing ketchup
