## Hi again

Only a month until school...

### Productive things

- Did the rest of the lecture
    - Over two days
- Talent show!
    - Recorded Pachtaoge with Disha
    - Was a massive procrastination fest
    - But very fun! 100% worth it
    - Figured out notes for the first time in a while
- Went to most PACT lectures for Group II
    - Went to everything after first lecture except for last Friday evening(Vihan)
- Freewrote a bit
    - Nothing very important, but it helped to just write

### Maybe not so productive things

- Went to four different places five different times over three days and spent at least 2 hours at each place
    - Puja (very long!): Friday afternoon/night
    - Manabadi photoshoot: Saturday morning
    - Another "puja" (ended up just being Reenu, Nikhi, and I hanging out with/without Milo because I arrived late): Saturday noon-evening
    - Baby shower?: Saturday night (also at Babai-Pinni's house)
    - Dinner: Sunday late afternoon-night (with Sanju and Sidharth)
- Consequently got sick
    - No idea what it is
    - Had to cancel lecture on Tuesday and reschedule to Thursday
    - Apparently I had to have a coughing fit in the middle of lecture Thursday :(
    - Was bad first two days and then got better but it hasn't gone away yet ;-;
    - So yes, I unfortunately had to sing on a sore throat
- Talked about very random stuff after lecture
- Lifted basketball hoop!
- Guacamole recipe:
    - 1/2 Avocado
    - A bit of onion (chopped)
    - Some lemon (squeezed)
    - A sprinkle of cumin
    - Salt
- Drew this:
