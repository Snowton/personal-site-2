## I'm a bit late this time

Oh, well.

### Productive things

- Did a lecture on Tuesday :D
    - Only got through half the material ;-;
    - But it was very fun
- Started on college essay brainstorming!
    - Began by taking walks (Disha's advice)
- Got my first 100% in Paradox and Infinity
- Accepted into MPFG :D
    - Hotels were booked super fast
- NC Scholarship sent an email out about prizes
- Finally got back to Laura and Dave
    - They didn't reply back yet
- Filled out Option II form
    - For a CS course, better luck

### Maybe not so productive things

I can't believe that I didn't mention the TSA application last time.

(I applied for Mascot.)

- Scraped my knee yesterday and now it looks like masala
    - (ft. turmeric)
    - It's a bit annoying to move around in general because it stings
- Saturday night at Varun Babai and Shilpa Pinni's house
    - Go Fish and Judgement
    - Paav Bhajis!
    - Also Alu Paratha and the other one (can't remember the name but it's greener)
- Consistently playing basketball outside!
    - But that's how I fell ^^;
- Planned and canceled a whole college visit trip
    - But we'll do it later
