## A streak of 2

The first time I updated, it was 6/2, and now it's 6/2**0**...

APs are over, HSCTF is over, Phi Day is over. Junior year is over. Summer has started. Things are boutta change.

### Productive things:

- Finish New Horizons
    - Can't wait to review the material B)
- Finish all APs
    - They went okay, I guess
- HSCTF
    - *grading*, *message-board*, *nrc*, *zkp*
    - Did some infra, but there's a whole lot I've gotta know for next time
- CS Club VP 2021!
- Phi Day Math Meet
    - Literally started the Thursday of. The meet was on Saturday.
    - Still made 40 problems, still hosted the meet, IT WORKED OUT
    - There were errors in 3 of the questions.
- Finished Junior Year
    - And all assignments with it :>
- Made a tentative plan for the **summer**

### Maybe not so productive things:

- Went to JProm. Had fun B)
    - Ended up going to Macy's for the dress, and spent a whole lotta time there
    - Ended up wearing a different dress (ordered online), but both were cool
    - The food was eh. Clearly cheap, but tasted good...
- Balanced dolphin after Phi Day (with Amy and Priya)
- Watched Luca
- Watched Senior Graduation! (with Allen and Jeremy)
