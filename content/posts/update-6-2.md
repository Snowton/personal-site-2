## Yeah, it's my first update.

Things I've done in the past week-ish:

### Productive things:
- Start the end of physics C prep.
- Start attending New Horizons. (It's more than halfway over ;-;.)
    - As a result, get pulled into way too many cool CS topics.
    - This time, there is an actual doc with links.
- Start the Sans Foundations course.
- Clean. up. my. room.

### Maybe not so productive things:
- Actually meet people this weekend!
- Still haven't gotten the dress.
