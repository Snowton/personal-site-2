## Hi :)

My name is Shreya.

This is probably going to be my personal site. We'll see.

## Goals

- Make a portfolio-over-the-years.
- Update regularly with what I've been working on.

## Attribution

This site is made using Hugo and its PaperMod theme! Legend goes that I looked at [3b1b's Manim documentation](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/) and loved its design. Obviously I have to start clicking on things to find more about this piece of code, so I came across [Pradyun's](https://pradyunsg.me/) website, and loved *this* design too. At this point I was kind of mind blown that there were really themes I thought were sleek and actually usable, so I zoomed over to Hugo, and a day later, here we are.

Probably my favorite thing is that there's an easy way to write math in here! Although it's not as versatile as Coffee and Sleep--you still need to use the terminal and write in files, and it's static, so you have to deploy new changes to master--I still really like it.

At first I was going to just use some template right out of the box, but that didn't really work out so well. I tried out a few themes, gave up on the ones that weren't PaperMod, and then figured I needed things to change about PaperMod too. It took a while to figure it out, but I did edit the search template to include links to tag/category search, the post pages to *actually* show the category (why isn't that default?), and the footer as well. I really did try to do something cool with the footer, but it didn't animate well, so here we are. Again, it took me a while to find *how* to edit the template in the first place, so I guess my chances were low. I think it was okay to just edit the submodule. I... don't know though... so let's hope PaperMod doesn't update.

Actually, I'm getting a bit scared. I'm going to put the code here.

### Half an hour later

I looked into the submodule issue. It was, obviously, an issue. So much for wishful thinking. But I just changed it, so it's not a submodule anymore, and I can edit however I like, but that also means I won't get updates. That's fine though--I can just add the actual submodule elsewhere, maybe?

I'll still put the code down there, though. For the curious, I guess.

See you around,\
Shreya
