## Hi :)

My name is Shreya.

This is probably going to be my personal site. We'll see.

## Goals

- Make a portfolio-over-the-years.
- Update regularly with what I've been working on.

## Attribution

This site is made using Hugo and its PaperMod theme! Legend goes that I looked at [3b1b's Manim documentation](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/) and loved its design. Obviously I have to start clicking on things to find more about this piece of code, so I came across [Pradyun's](https://pradyunsg.me/) website, and loved *this* design too. At this point I was kind of mind blown that there were really themes I thought were sleek and adaptable for use, so I zoomed over to Hugo, and a day later, here we are.

Probably my favorite thing is that there's an easy way to write math in here! Although it's not as versatile as Coffee and Sleep--you still need to use the terminal and write in files, and it's static, so you have to deploy new changes to master--I still really like it.

I did edit the Search template to include links to tag/category search, and the footer as well. I really tried to do something cool with the footer, but it didn't animate well, so here we are. It took me a while to figure out *how* to edit the template in the first place. I think it was okay to just edit the submodule. I... don't know though... so let's hope PaperMod doesn't update.

Actually, I'm getting a bit scared. I'm going to put the code here.
